//IT IS ONE OF THE MAJOR OOP CONCEPT
//USED FOR THE DATA ENCAPSULATION!

//AN ABSTRACT CLASS IS CREATED HERE
//ABSTRACTIO IS ALSO USED FOR DATA ENCAPSULATION BUT THIS IS NOT MUCH EFFICENT AS INTERFACES
//METHODS INSIDE THIS CAN OR CAN'T BE ABSTRACT

    //HERE IS AN EXAMPLE

    //1. ABSTRACT VOID MOVETOCONNECT

    //ONE METHOD IS ABSTRACT AND OTHER ONE IS NOT!
